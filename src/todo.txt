bugs:
* IndexOutOfrangeException in DotNet.Glob when applying source filter **/blah
* occasional failure to read num tests from nunit result file: try latest nunit runner?

robustness:
* validate config:
	* no test assemblies
	* duplicate test assembly (filename?)
* if tests are failing before mutation, then we'll get no survivors :/
* Handle tests timing out
* a failure to run a single mutation would crash the entire process. Should carry on and show a warning?

features:
* allow user to ignore surviving mutants they can't/won't fix (being/end comment convention?)
* More mutation types
	* if(thing) vs if(!thing)
	* others? += -= *= /= ...

perf:
>>> * Consider less permutations, e.g. ">" to just ">=" instead of [<,<=] as well
* Compiling mutants in release mode? Does release still work but improve speed?
* compile and run tests in memory?
	* or at least load NUnit into memory

output:
* output duration
